# Why Imitation is the Fastest Way to Make Money

## The Pitfalls of Learning from Scratch
While learning is valuable, it’s often too slow to capitalize on fleeting market opportunities. By the time you master a skill, the opportunity may have passed. Many dream of creating something entirely new, believing originality is the only path to success. However, reality is harsh—most original ventures fail due to high trial-and-error costs. Meanwhile, those who quietly thrive often replicate proven business models, adapting them to new contexts for quick wins.

## Why Imitation Works
Imitation is the fastest route to profitability for three key reasons:

### 1. High Cost of Trial and Error
In fast-moving markets, time is the most precious resource. Experimenting blindly burns time and money, often leading to failure before you even understand the game. Copying a proven model skips 90% of the pitfalls, letting you focus on execution rather than reinvention.

### 2. Leveraging Proven Models
Business is a game of probabilities. Copying a successful model is like borrowing a winning playbook. For example:
- Street vendors replicate popular recipes to attract customers.
- E-commerce sellers mimic bestselling products with slight tweaks.
- Even tech giants like Alibaba (inspired by eBay) and Didi (inspired by Uber) started by adapting proven models to local markets.

As the *Tao Te Ching* states: “With the right path, techniques can be mastered; without it, techniques alone lead nowhere.” The “path” is the proven model; the “technique” is how you adapt it.

### 3. Speed Over Perfection
Waiting for the perfect plan or over-innovating often means missing the boat. Those who act fast, even imperfectly, seize opportunities. For instance:
- Kudi Coffee mirrored Luckin Coffee’s strategy:
  - Low-priced coffee (9.9 yuan) to attract users.
  - Celebrity endorsements for viral marketing.
  - Zero franchise fees to rapidly scale stores.
- Kudi opened 10,000 stores in just two years, compared to Luckin’s six, with a mere 3.6% closure rate. By opening near Luckin stores, Kudi tapped into an existing customer base, forcing Luckin to counter with its own 9.9-yuan deals.

## Imitation: A Timeless Strategy
Imitation is woven into the fabric of commerce, from ancient Silk Road traders to modern e-commerce. Why? Because human nature—greed, convenience, and the desire for value—remains constant. Examples:
- Ancient market stalls used “loss leader” tactics, just like today’s “9.9 yuan free shipping” deals.
- Small businesses in developing nations mimic successful Western models, adapting them locally.

The commercial world is like a set of nesting dolls: lower tiers copy middle tiers, middle tiers copy top tiers, and developing markets copy developed ones. Success is often just a remix of old ideas in new packaging.

## Case Study: Bawang Chaji
Bawang Chaji, a rising tea brand, exemplifies strategic imitation:
- **Branding**: Modeled after Chayan Yuese’s aesthetic.
- **Management**: Borrowed Huawei’s operational rigor.
- **Marketing**: Adopted Apple and Procter & Gamble’s storytelling.
- **Design**: Drew inspiration from luxury brands.
By standing on the shoulders of giants, Bawang Chaji carved a profitable niche without reinventing the wheel.

## Three Skills for Effective Imitation
Imitation isn’t just copying—it requires skill. Here’s what you need:

### 1. Sharp Observation
Profit lies in information gaps. For example:
- Ancient trader Zhang Qian brought silk and spices to China, selling common goods at a premium.
- In the 1990s, Chinese merchants sold cheap lighters in Russia for massive profits due to supply shortages.
Cross-industry learning, real-world networking, and stepping outside your bubble uncover these opportunities.

### 2. Relentless Execution
Ideas are worthless without action. As Wang Yangming said, “Practice through action.” Those who execute quickly—copying what works and adapting it—win. Hesitation or perfectionism kills momentum.

### 3. Result-Driven Iteration
Focus on outcomes, not ego. A street vendor copying a rival’s sweet potato recipe but adding small conveniences (like disposable gloves) can dominate the market. Test, tweak, and improve rapidly to minimize costly mistakes.

## Embrace Pragmatism
Innovation is romantic but risky—most pioneers fail. Imitation, while less glamorous, is the grassroots path to success. Even Newton said, “I stand on the shoulders of giants.” For ordinary people, the goal is simple: copy a proven model, make it your own, and iterate. Clear your biases, embrace the market, and prioritize results. Earning a living for you and your family is nothing to be ashamed of.

Start as a “copy machine” to build a viable business, then innovate to make it uniquely yours. Why wade through uncharted waters when you can follow a proven path?
